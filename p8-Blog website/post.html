          Krafton, the South Korean developer of superhit mobile games PUBG and BGMI, has broken its silence on the BGMI ban in India. The mobile game has been taken off Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Battlegrounds Mobile India, however, is available for those who already have it. The company said it is trying to resolve the issues with the concerned authorities. Hyunil Sohn, the CEO of Krafton India, said, "We kindly request you to wait to hear from us. We will keep you informed about further updates. We look forward to strengthing our partnerships and collectively fostering the gaming ecosystem in India."
        </p>
        <p>
          "There may be questions in your minds regarding the current situation about the country's most loved game -- BGMI. In line with this, we have been working hard to communicate our sincerity with the concerned authorities and resolve the issues," the company said.

The Central government banned PUBG in September 2020 under Section 69 A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, over privacy breach concerns. There were reports that the game was sending user data to Tencent's servers. BGMI was launched in 2021.
        </p>
        <h2>What did google Say</h2>
        <p>
          According to reports, BGMI was also removed from the two leading app stores under the same IT Act section.

Krafton had said it was clarifying with the government why the game was removed from the app stores.

         "We are committed to the Indian market and are positive about the opportunities in the country. At Krafton Inc, the security and privacy of our user data are of utmost importance to us. We have always been compliant with all laws and regulations in India including data protection laws and regulations and will continue abiding by them," he added.

         Programming is, quite literally, all around us. From the take-out we order, to the movies we stream, code is ever present in our lives. Whether you are about to start your journey as a web developer, can’t decide which language to learn first, or just want to increase your digital literacy, learning programming fundamentals will be beneficial to your career.

In this series of lessons, you’ll explore ideas that are at the heart of learning how to code and start writing your own code!
        </p>
        <p>
         You will get a solid foundation in key programming concepts such as variables, functions, and control flow. Learning these concepts will set you up for success in any programming language that you choose to learn!
        </p>
        <h2>Why learn Coding</h2>
        <p>
Coding can boost problem solving and logic skills
Outside from the implications of coding which look good on a resume, coding actually does boost skills which are actually useful to most jobs. Problem solving and logic are the main two. Learning to code is like an exercise session for the “left” side of the brain.

<br>

Coding improves interpersonal skills
Coding for most big projects tends to be a collaborative effort. This means having to work as one cog as part of a greater team. Learning how to best interact with bosses and co-workers is an essential work skill, and it can often be developed through coding.
<br>

Being a skilled coder can build confidence
Knowing you have a desirable skill in a competitive job market can help you become more confident in your own abilities. It’s also quite an addictive process – the more you learn, the more you’ll want to learn. Knowing that any problem which could stump most people is easily solved by you is empowering.
