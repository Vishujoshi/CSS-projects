        Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomen

The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birt In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physi, which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop of their own accord The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word  by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.

        “Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better” -Albert Einstein.

 

My name is Davis Beckett, I am 11 years old and have always enjoyed spending time outside.  From going on hikes with my family, to climbing the tree in our backyard or even swimming at the beach where my Grampa and Nana live. I just like being outside whenever and wherever I can!  The one thing I enjoy the most about nature though is being surrounded by the forest.  There is just something about how the forest surrounds me that makes me feel at home, it’s a peaceful and calm place that makes me happy.  I like to close my eyes and take it all in.  You can smell the moss on the trees, hear the sounds of a stream running close by and you can feel the forest floor beneath your feet.  It’s comforting like a cozy blanket on a cold day.
